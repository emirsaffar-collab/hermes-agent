"""Lock-owner attribution on non-Linux hosts (macOS) — 2026-09-28 RCA follow-up.

Incident receipt: during the 10:17–10:21 lock storm, the exhausted-patience
logger emitted 38 lines of "no write-class lock held at the deadline (the holder
released just before it)" because ``state_db_write_lock_holders`` returned [] on
any non-Linux platform (hermes_state_lockowners gated on sys.platform — macOS
has no /proc/locks, and fcntl byte-range lock owners are not enumerable there
at all).

That empty fallback reads as "nobody held it", which is false-by-omission: the
holder existed and was later named by the in-process holder warning. macOS
cannot name the lock OWNER, but the tree's holder authority names every process
with the db (or a WAL sidecar) open — the candidate set that contains the
holder.

The real cross-process psutil scan is probe-verified on this machine (skeptic
2026-09-28, /tmp probe) but the live scan can hit unrelated processes touching
the real hermes home, which upstream's anti-test-fixture guard turns into a
pid=-1 "unproven" sentinel. So these tests drive the scan through a controlled
fake psutil and own the contract that matters here: the FALLBACK WIRING and its
honest wording. The Linux /proc/locks path keeps its exact semantics
(test_write_lock_owner_attribution.py).
